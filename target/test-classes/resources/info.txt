Test 1: Validate a user is able to add a category and once the category is added it should display.

Test 2: Validate a user is not able to add a duplicated category. If it does then the following message will display: "The category you want to add already exists: <duplicated category name>."

Test 3: Validate the month drop down has all the months (jan, feb, mar ...) in the Due Date dropdown section.
